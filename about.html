                Hello World, my name is Felipe. I was born and raised in Buenos Aires Argentina.
                Becoming a programmer was always my professional dream. The FrontEnd Developer Bootcamp here in Israel opened 
                the doors to a new world. In programming I found a way to combine two of my passions: design and creating things that can be meaningful and make life easier for people. 
                I love the Bauhaus School of Design idea, and I am influenced by great design masters such as Le Corbusier, Mies Van der Rohe, Tadao Ando, Zaha Hadid, Phillips Starck 
                and Santiago Calatrava among others. During my professional life, I have worked in many different areas and businesses. This allows me to understand and analyze 
                problems with an open mind and a unique perspective.
